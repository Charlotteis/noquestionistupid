This is a repo for all my absolutely NOT stupid questions I have about web development. I will pose questions in the issue tracker of this repository. I will provide my own answers if I can but would really appreciate it if others could take a look at the question and add their own answers.

Right now the intention is to mark questions as "solved" but not close them, because other input is always encouraged (as long as it's pertinent to the question at hand, obviously)

Any questions that are a hard tackle may be written up as a blog post once it's been answered, in order to help others learn. If and when that time comes, I'll ask any contributors to the question if I can include their comments/answers.

Now, let's do this.
