This is a repo for all my absolutely NOT stupid questions I have about web development. I will pose questions in the issue tracker of this repository. I will provide my own answers if I can but would really appreciate it if others could take a look at the question and add their own answers.

When I think a question has been sufficiently answered, I will label the question with "answered" and eventually close the issue. **However** as we all know, things change rapidly in web and something answered now, may not be right in the future. I encourage people to take a look at the closed issues and add new and constructive input where they can.

Any questions that are a hard tackle may be written up as a blog post once it's been answered, in order to help others learn. If and when that time comes, I'll ask any contributors to the question if I can include their comments/answers.

Now, let's do this.
